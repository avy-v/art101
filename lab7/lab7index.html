					<p>In term of challenges the coding process for the name sorting functon were rellativly simple, reason being that we did kinda go over it in lecture. I would have to say that I was kinda confused as how to stop my css from dying lol. but i was ablr to get it after a couple of edits.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>𝒫𝓇𝑜𝒷𝓁𝑒𝓂𝓈</h2>
					<p>There weren't a whole lot of problems. It really wasn't with the coding but more with how i usually format the text and the navigation linkage.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>𝑅𝑒𝓈𝓊𝓁𝓉𝓈</h2>
					<p>I really like how it came out. It works and is really fun to mess around with.</p>
